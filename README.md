- Added firestore connection to app
- deleted local storage
- Reworked:
     - adding todo uploads it to database
     - each reload todolist is downloaded from database
     - added docId variable to todo object because of need to have id to each database document. (for update / delete todo)
     - clearing todos delete them from database too
     - toggling todos changed its state in database too
     - categories are created from todo.category while downloading todos from database
